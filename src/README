(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/cs255000/demo/c/set2/a.out 

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000000004004df in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe9d8) at crash1.c:17

(GDB tells us the program crashed at line 17 in the file crash1.c)

(gdb) where

(Ask GDB to tell where the program stopped.
 GDB tells us: line 17 in the file crash1.c)

(gdb) list

(Ask GDB to list the program source around the place where the program stopped.
 GDB gives us about 10 lines of text....


Conclusion: the execution of a[i] = 1234 caused the error....
Find out the value of these variables !!!

(gdb) p i
$1 = -872625577

(Ask GDB to show us the value of the variable i
 GDB gives us -872625577

(gdb) print a[i]
Cannot access memory at address 0x7fff2ff3121c

(Ask GDB to show us the value of the variable a[i]
 GDB gives us -872625577
